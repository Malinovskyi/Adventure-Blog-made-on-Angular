      The Adventure Blog is more than a website. We are a community of

      The Adventure Blog was started in 2007 as a Blogspot and has morphed into
      a real site with a huge following and a social community full of some of
      the biggest names in climbing, hiking, exploring biking, traveling, and
      any other adventures!
