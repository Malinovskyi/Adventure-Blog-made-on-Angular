      'Author and adventurer Neal Moore has completed an epic journey across the US by canoe. The long-distance paddler reached the end of his expedition on December 15, arriving in New York City where he took a much-deserved victory lap. All told, by the time he reached the finish line, Moore had spent the better part of the past two years on this project, covering more than 7450 miles (12,000 km) using 22 rivers to visit 22 states while en route.',

      "Moore's journey started on February 9, 2020, just a few short weeks before COVID left its indelible mark on the planet. He began the trip in Astoria, Oregon with grand plans of crossing the US and documenting the current mood of the country leading up to the November 2020 elections. The pandemic had other plans for him however and the journey ended up taking some very unexpected turns. That included exiting Oregon in late March of last year, just as a shelter-in-place order was about to take effect. Rather than completing the trip in nine months as originally planned, Moore ended up spending nearly two years paddling some of America’s great rivers. He started by paddling upstream on the Columbia, Snake, and Clark Fork Rivers on his way to crossing the Continental Divide. From there, he traveled south along the Missouri and Mississippi, all the way to the Gulf of Mexico.After over-wintering on the Gulf, he started upstream again, paddling the Tombigbee and Ohio Rivers to Pittsburgh and proceeding east to Buffalo. From there, he paddled the Eerie Canal for 180 miles (289 km) before portaging overland to the Hudson River, which took him into New York. When he reached the city last week, Moore paddled with friends out into the harbor, where he rowed around the Statue of Liberty before putting a cap on his adventure.Upon completion of his transcontinental crossing, Moore became the first person to make a continuous, solo journey across the US from west to east. This wasn’t his first attempt at this expedition, however. In 2018 he set off on the same course but had to abandon his paddle in Montana amidst record flooding. He had covered approximately 1700 miles (2735 km), but rather than restart at that same point in 2020, he covered that leg of the trip a second time.As you can probably imagine, there were a number of challenges that popped up along the way. The pandemic obviously made things challenging while he was in a town or city, but while he was out on the water Moore was safely alone. He did run into difficult sections of high water once again and on his final push into Manhattan he ended up paddling backward for four miles due to high winds. On the Mississippi, he was nearly run down by a barge that was unable to see his small canoe in the darkness. Thankfully, he avoided disaster in each of those cases.",

      'Way back in May of 2019, we told you that Tanzania was exploring the possibility of building a cable car that would run to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. At the time, the idea seemed somewhat far fetched, although there were people involved in the project that were serious about making such an engineering feat happen.Upon completion of his transcontinental crossing, Moore became the first person to make a continuous, solo journey across the US from west to east.',

      'As one of the top adventure travel destinations in Africa—if not the entire world—Tanzania has seen its economy suffer during the COVID pandemic. Prior to the spread of the virus, upwards of 50,000 people flocked to the country each year just to climb Kilimanjaro—the highest peak in Africa. Tens of thousands more visited to take in the Great Migration and go on safari on the Serengeti. But the coronavirus has all-but brought that industry to a halt and recovery has been slow.In 2019, tourism contributed 10.7% to Tanzania’s Gross Domestic Product, but in 2020 that number fell to just 5.3%. This year, things haven’t improved all that dramatically and as in other parts of the world, recovery has been slow in coming. Naturally, this has led to government officially looking for ways to jump start that economy. The Kilimanjaro cable car is now seen as a way to do just that.Veteran adventurers Justin Packshaw and Jamie Facer Childs set off on what they call the Chasing the Light expedition back on November 11. The duo began their ambitious journey the Russian Novolazarevskaya Station with some enormously challenging goals in mind. Using skis and kites, they hoped to cover more than 4200 km (2609 miles) in 80 days, traveling through one of the most desolate, difficult, and unforgiving regions of the planet.Originally, the idea was to go from Novo Station to Antarctic South Pole of Inaccessbility, which would have covered 1770 km (1100 miles) alone. After that, the plan was to turn to the geographic South Pole, which sits approximately 900 km (560 miles) from the POI. That wouldn’t be the team’s finish line, however, as they also planned to ski 1290 km (802 miles) to Hercules Inlet, before reaching their final destination at Union Glacier, another 200 km (124 miles) away.Unfortunately, things haven’t been going as expected and Packshaw and Facer Childs have already had to alter those plans. Because surface conditions have not been as favorable as they would like—and the winds haven’t cooperated with their kites—the duo are moving slower than expected. As a result, they’ve now given up on their idea of reaching the POI and have turned towards 90ºS instead.As you can probably imagine, there were a number of challenges that popped up along the way. The pandemic obviously made things challenging while he was in a town or city, but while he was out on the water Moore was safely alone.

      'In December of last year, things started to get more serious, however, when the Tanzania government officially approved construction. At the time, they were still looking for partners to assist with funding and planning, which was a major challenge amidst the global pandemic.
